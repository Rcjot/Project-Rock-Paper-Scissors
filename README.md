i still don't know how to properly make a pseudocode, maybe im just lazy...

my pseudocode:
/*

prompt user for move

rng computer for move

compare moves and decide winner

declare winner declare score


*/

worked in branch....


basically gethumanchoice() function is gone, replaced with three eventlistener buttons rock paper scissors...

had trouble with how to set things up...

things aren't looking good so far without the layout, will do later.

was tired so updated this the next day

we learned:
> how event listeners really work
> disabling buttons by setAttribute("disabled", "disabled")
> setting buttons back by removeAttribute("disabled")
> we can add images, just as any other elements
> we can assign image source with elem.src = "address/myImage"
> assign defined img element to another src by, having reference to an id, and just assign as img1.src = img2.src.


all in all took around 6 hrs to finish this, building and thinking included.
